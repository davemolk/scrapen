# scrapen
This is going to be both a sandbox for scraping and a repo for some larger scrapers/crawlers/etc.

I'll be using a mix of requests, requests_html, beautiful soup, scrapy, playwright, and selenium (so far).

Scrapers in the sandbox are using Mitchell's Web Scraping with Python, 2nd Edition, as a starting point.
